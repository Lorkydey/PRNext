# Compatibility and migration

[AI documentation index](../../AI.md)

## Treat compatibility as a checked contract

PRNext adapts many public Next.js conventions; it is not a drop-in implementation
of every Next.js version. Package installation, a recognized import or a green
source audit does not prove an application works. The installed package's
metadata, declarations, diagnostics and executable behavior are the authority
for this release. Do not use an old repository checklist to override them.

Common supported areas include App/Pages routing, React Server Components,
Server Actions, request APIs, navigation, route metadata, supported cache APIs,
CSS Modules and the project's PostCSS pipeline. Scope varies by runtime and
option. Advanced parallel/intercepting routing, custom webpack/loaders, package
transpilation, image/font tooling and caching deserve targeted build and browser
tests. Support for one configuration shape does not imply support for all
upstream plugin behavior.

Configuration uses one `next.config.*` or `prnext.config.*` file and rejects
unknown keys rather than ignoring them. `reactCompiler: false` is accepted;
enabling React Compiler is explicitly unsupported. `typedRoutes: true` is
implemented through PRNext's generated route registry. Do not copy a full
Next.js configuration template into a new application.

Only explicit private Next.js import adapters are supported. Do not add arbitrary
`next/dist/...` imports or install another Next runtime to satisfy one: isolate
or replace the incompatible dependency, retain the original framework where
needed, and describe the limitation honestly.

## Migrate conservatively

Use the project's existing package manager. For npm, install the intended
published PRNext release and its matching React peers, then inspect the dry run:

```sh
npm i --save-exact @thomas.f/prnext react@19.3.1 react-dom@19.3.1 react-server-dom-webpack@19.3.1
npx --no-install prnext migrate --dry-run
npx --no-install prnext migrate --check --json
```

Review scripts, manager/workspace detection, configuration and reported source
conflicts. When the plan is correct:

```sh
npx --no-install prnext migrate
npx --no-install prnext check --json
npx --no-install prnext typecheck
npx --no-install prnext build
```

Migration changes selected scripts/dependencies, backs up package files and
existing lockfiles, and keeps Next.js and application source. Public `next/*`
imports can remain. Do not remove Next, replace all imports or recreate the
application without a separate need.

Installation honors npm, pnpm and Yarn Classic/Berry and the owning workspace
root. Conflicting managers, unsafe filesystem entries and unlisted workspaces
can block automatic install. `migrate --no-install` prepares the manifest for
manual manager execution. Custom shell scripts may require a manual edit.
An installation failure attempts safe manifest/lockfile restoration; it cannot
roll back every dependency directory or manager cache. Never solve peer conflicts
by silently adding `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`.

`migrate --check` audits without applying a migration. Configuration evaluation
can run project code, and installed custom loaders still require a real build.
The audit is not a sandbox for untrusted projects.

## Compare running applications

Start the original application and the candidate on separate available ports.
Create `paths.json` with representative concrete URLs:

```json
["/", "/products/demo", "/api/health"]
```

Then compare public GET responses:

```sh
prnext migrate --check --against http://localhost:3000 --candidate http://localhost:3001 --routes paths.json
```

The comparison does not authenticate or follow redirects. It compares response
samples, including status, content type and selected body semantics; it does not
prove hydration, styling, actions or all dynamic routes. Visit important routes
in a real browser, test authorized and unauthorized states, and run the existing
application tests. Keep the original setup available until the candidate is
actually verified. Timings from this comparison are not controlled benchmarks.

## Boundaries that often matter

React server/client directives in `.mts`/`.cts` are rejected; use `.ts`/`.tsx`.
App Route Handlers use Web Request/Response, while Pages APIs retain their own
request/response contract. App and Pages router hooks are not interchangeable.
Edge code cannot assume Node APIs or Node-only package behavior.

HTTP/1 WebSockets can tunnel through supported external HTTP(S) rewrites and
hosting gateways; App/Pages handlers do not gain a WebSocket server API. Static
imports accept completed public browser output, not another framework's SSR
server. See [Deployment](deployment.md) before choosing an adapter.

When a feature is missing, give its exact failing API/option and a supported
alternative. Do not claim full compatibility, invent a replacement method or
mask the error with an empty shim.
